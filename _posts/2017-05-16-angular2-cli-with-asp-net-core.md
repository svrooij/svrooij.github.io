If you're creating a new Angular2 application, you definitely want to use the <a href="https://cli.angular.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular2 CLI</a>. It help you setup a new Angular application. It has a build-in development server and it will generate **Components** for you. This means less typing (isn't that always better?).
