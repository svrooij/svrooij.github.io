Azure Functions share a lot with ASP.NET core, but some really useful things aren't supported by default. I was missing the [configuration stuff](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/) when building an Azure Functions app.

<!--more-->

## What is missing

ASP.NET core loads a few configuration sources by default, and they are really useful.

- `appsettings.json` the **default** configuration file
- `appsettings.{environment}.json` the environment specific config file.
- Some other providers (see above link)

Azure functions does look for an `appsettings.json` but that is the one in the Azure Functions runtime folder. So lets restore the asp.net core configuration functionality.

## 1. Nuget package

First you'll need an extra nuget package `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions`, so go ahead and install it.

## 2. Startup file

Create a special Azure Functions startup file (if you haven't already).

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using System;

[assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(YourNamespace.Startup))]
namespace YourNamespace
{
  public class Startup : FunctionsStartup
  {
    public override void ConfigureAppConfiguration(IFunctionsConfigurationBuilder builder)
    {
      // Set filenames, adjust accordingly
      string basePath = Startup.IsDevelopmentEnvironment() ?
        Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AzureWebJobsScriptRoot") :
        $"{Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("HOME")}\\site\\wwwroot";
      var baseSettings = System.IO.Path.Combine(basePath, "appsettings.json");
      var envSettings = System.IO.Path.Combine(basePath, $"appsettings.{Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_FUNCTIONS_ENVIRONMENT")}.json");

      // Add the configuration providers.
      builder.ConfigurationBuilder
        .AddJsonFile(baseSettings, optional: true, reloadOnChange: false)
        .AddJsonFile(envSettings, optional: true, reloadOnChange: false);
    }

    public override void Configure(IFunctionsHostBuilder builder)
    {
      // This has to be here, but we don't add any services
    }

    private static bool IsDevelopmentEnvironment()
    {
      // This variable is set by the Azure Functions runtime, you can also use your own logic.
      return "Development".Equals(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_FUNCTIONS_ENVIRONMENT"), StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Add the settings file(s)

You are now ready to add the `appsettings.json` file and optionally the `appsettings.yourenvironment.json` files. Be sure to mark them as **Copy always** or **Copy if newer**.

You can now use your setting files like you're used to. âœ… all done.

### Access configuration while adding services

Did you know you can access the configuration when you're adding services in the above startup file?

```csharp
public override void Configure(IFunctionsHostBuilder builder)
{
  // Get the context (which has the configuration)
  var config = builder.GetContext().Configuration;
  // Do something depending on some value
  var configValue = config.GetValue<string>("your_key");
}
```
