Don't you hate those games that keep appearing on your facebook timelime or in the notifications? Facebook has a feature to totally block an app.

## [Block (annoying) facebook apps](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=blocking)

The apps I blocked are most of the apps containing `*ville` or `*sage` or `*bash`. They also have a nice search function. Just type one of these words and click the most used ones.
