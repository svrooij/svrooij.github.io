With my Windows computer I could control the power button action.

I was a bit disappointed that you cannot control this action on a Mac. But now I found out that there is a keyboard shortcut to instantly shutdown your mac.

`CMD` + `alt` + `ctrl` + `Power button`

I know it is a horrible shortcut, but it works!!
