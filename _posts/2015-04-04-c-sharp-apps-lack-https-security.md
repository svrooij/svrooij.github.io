If you're searching the web on how to communicate with your development server (probably not hosted with a correct SSL certificate), most sites tell you to include the following code to your project.

```csharp
ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = (sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => {
	Console.WriteLine("Certificaat: {0}",certificate.Subject);
	Console.WriteLine("SslPolicy: {0}",sslPolicyErrors);
	return true; //This row is the problem. If you don't know why, I wouldn't use apps from your company!
};
```

While this is perfectly fine during the development phase, you should make sure this part is **NEVER** included in your project that will be deployed somewhere!
