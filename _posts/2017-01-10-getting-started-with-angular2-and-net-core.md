I've found a few nice articles to get you started with Angular 2 and .NET core. Normally it would be somewhat of a hassle to get started, but this should provide you with some working samples.

This is a series of posts by Jon Hilton and uses the [ASP.NET Core Template Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.ASPNETCoreTemplatePack) to get started.
