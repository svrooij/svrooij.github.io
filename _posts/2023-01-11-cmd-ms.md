## What is CMD.ms

[cmd.ms](https://cmd.ms) is an [open-source](https://github.com/merill/cmd) URL shortner for Microsoft portals. That's it, thanks for reading.

Just kidding, it is an URL shortner for **164** deeplinks to admin pages. That's right you can open all those admin portals by learning their shortcode.

It works by typing one of these url's in the browser and you get redirected to the right portal at it's long not rememberable url. Either use `{shortcode}.cmd.ms` or `cmd.ms/{shortcode}`

### My favorite shortcodes

- `adappreg` Entra portal - App registrations
- `adentapp` Entra portal - Enterprise applications
- `azfn` Azure portal - All function apps

These are my favorites, quick and easy. Check the [homepage](https://cmd.ms/) to see all available links.

## Add cmd.ms to Edge

I added cmd.ms to edge, so I can type `ms` + `[TAB]` and then the shortcode followed by an `[ENTER]` to visit my desired portal, in even less keys.

1. Click profile picture and press manage profile settings or open [settings](edge://settings/profiles)
2. Click **Privacy, site and services** in the sidebar.
3. Scroll down to **Services** and click **Address bar and search**
4. Click **Manage search engines**
5. Click the **Add** button
6. Fill in the details search engine `cmd.ms`, shortcut `ms` and url `https://cmd.ms/%s`
7. Press **Add** to add it to your search engine collection.

Try it out in a new tab in the address bar.
