I like to make my Team meetings a little more interactive, so I use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to make my webcam look more awesome. I've setup hosting for some javascript clock I found on the web somewhere.

## Introducing the analog clock overlay

OBS allows you to overlay you webcam with all sort of things, there also is a [browser source](https://obsproject.com/wiki/Sources-Guide#:~:text=Browser%20source%20is%20one%20of,video%2C%20and%20even%20audio%20tasks.) The browser source allows to you add a webpage as an overlay to your "production", it even "hides" the background automatically by turning the background color to transparant with some custom css.

1. Add a new browser source to a new scene.
2. Set the url to `https://svrooij.io/overlays/clock.html`
3. And set the height to half the width. Height: `175` width: `350` works great for me.
4. Drag the clock to the right spot.

## How does the clock work

The clock is just a [page](/overlays/clock.html) with some javascript on it. It takes the current time of your computer and updates the clock accordingly every 100ms.
